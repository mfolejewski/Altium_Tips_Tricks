Altium Designer Tips&Tricks - TIP #09 -> define mechanical layers.

Hello PCB designers! I have a proposal how to name, use and configure mechanical layers in the Altium Designer at PCB editor.

So this is it:
The first 16 layers (M01 - M16) I used for PCB designing purposes and next 16 layers (M17 - M32) I used for PCB footprint library creating purposes.

In my proposal, you can find layers definition for assembly drawings, for 3D body models, for test points, for board and panel outline, etc.

You can download my mechanical layers settings (from GitHub):
https://github.com/mfolejewski/Altium_Tips_Tricks/blob/master/TIP%20%2309/mechanical_layers_setup.stackup

Next, you can import that mechanical layers settings by open the file *.stackup to your PCB design or PCB footprint editor: 
PCB Editor => Menu => Tools => Import Mechanicals Layers...

How to implement my layers proposal in your PCB libraries? Just open my example PCB library and check, analyze or copy created PCB footprints. 

Here you can download my example PCB footprint library that uses proposed mechanical layers setup (from GitHub):
