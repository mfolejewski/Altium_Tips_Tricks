Altium Designer Tips&Tricks - TIP #03 -> add the title block to each schematic sheet.

Remember to always add the title block on each sheet of your schematic.
This thing is like a information board for your project and can help to identify the different schematic sheets, know what revision of the project is, who designed this and to know other useful data.

The title block should contain all necessary informations about the schematic sheet and the project, at least the following data:
- title of the schematic page,
- name of the project,
- name of the applied assembly variant,
- version/revision of the project,
- schematic sheet number and total count of the schematic pages,
- date of the last update and the printout date,
- name of the schematic designer.

Title block should be placed on the bottom right corner of the sheet.

Please, see the attached example (the drawing). 

How to design your own title block: see this video (thanks Robert Feranec!):

example of using a title block inserted from the SCH library into the schematic sheet: please see Schematic_example.SchDoc and title_block_lib.SchLib

use the schematic template: Schematic_template_A3.SchDot
