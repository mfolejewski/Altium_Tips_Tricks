Altium Designer Tips&Tricks - TIP #05 -> add marking in your PCB design.

Remember to always add the non-component objects for marking in your PCB design.
These objects can be very useful during the PCB manufacturing, assembly and testing process.

You can place marking on your PCB, such as: company logo, manufacturing date, layer indicator, fiducial markers, ICT/FCT test points, barcode area or reference holes.

You can simply create a dedicated PCB library, that will be contain all the marking components.

Please, see the attached example (the drawing). 

You can download my example library for the PCB marking (demo):
